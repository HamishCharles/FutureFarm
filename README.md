# Future Farm Technical Test

## Notes
 - UI is rudimentary but works
 - Tests are incomplete because I needed more time to work out how to test react-leaflet components

## Prerequisits

First up you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to run the build tools & test runner.

## Getting Started

To install the app dependencies do a
```
npm install
```


Run app in the development mode.
```
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Run unit tests
